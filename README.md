## General info
Purpose of inputing FEN notation is to set up the game state from where we want to begin and to be able to save the game state and continue after exiting the CLI app unless we want to start a fresh game for which there's no need to input FEN notation

## Usage example

```
$ ./chessengine
Input Forsyth-Edwards chess notation: k7/p1R1b1PP/1pN4p/P1Pq1pr1/ppnRP1P1/2pbQ2B/p2N1PPK/2n1Br2 w - - 0 1
Enter Rank/Column(a-h):c
Enter File/Row(1-8):7
```
